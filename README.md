# web-scraping-product-cost-data-from-NFZ-website
product_dataset() is a function for scraping health-products-cost-data from multiple locations within Polish NFZ-s Contract Information Register (https://www.nfz.gov.pl/o-nfz/informator-o-zawartych-umowach/). The function agruments are: "year", "OW", "prod_name" which stand for: "year", "Provincial Branches of the National Health Fund's code" and "name of contracted product" respectively. The function returns a csv file with comprehensive dataset for further analysis.
For exaple, after sourcing my script "provider_product_data.R" into you R session, try: provider_product_data("2019", "01", "tlenoterapia+domowa"). 
If you want to find relevant data for a wider scope of time (years), make a function mapping, for expamle if you want to get data about "tlenoterapia+domowa" for "01" Provincial Branches of the National Health Fund's code from year 2012 to 2018, do this:
> source("/place/where/you/downloaded/this/script/product_dataset.R")

> years <- as.character(2012:2019)

> for (year in years) {provider_product_data(year, "01", "tlenoterapia+domowa")} 

You can also mapp this function in different ways depending on what dataset you need to get.

After gaining the data, in order to analyze them, change columns types to appropriate ones. See a script "column_type_convertion.R" which cover an instruction on how to cleanse and convert type of data imported directly from web service or from .csv file.
